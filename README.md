## Overview

A one stop webpage to get all the nutritional values of any searched food items as well as top eight recipies from around the web with links to the full recipes.



### The challenge

This week we were challenged to work collaboratively with a team of peers to build this webpage from concept to deployment. Our objective was to have a minimum viable product ready for release.

## Our process
We had to find two different working free Api's and from there come up with a way to utilize them in a project. We had many attempts with different ideas and eventually landed on one for recipes and one for nutritional values. From there we just had to divide the work load fairly and get to work.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Javascript
- Jquery
- Flexbox
- Bootstrap
- Mobile-first workflow

## What we learned
For the most part the newest part of building this page was learning to work in a team, take on smaller pieces of the whole, the process of give and take, as well as learning new aspects of GitHub - project side, the board, switching branches, pushing to main and accepting other team members pull requests.
<br>


We've also learned the importance of collaborative learning and sharing of ideas to foster creativity. Through this process, we have challenged ourselves to continue our learning on integrating two different API's and retrieving information from the database to display on our web application.

## Continued development

For future development, our aim is to introduce a feature that provides users with healthy smoothie recipes to complement their healthy meal choices.
Additionally, we will include a health and wellness blog to provide users with informative articles on healthy eating and wellness.
